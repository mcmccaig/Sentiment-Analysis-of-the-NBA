Honestly as a Milwaukee resident what Giannis has done for our team (which was horrible for decades) has been unreal on and off the court. This city is buzzing and it’s amazing to be apart of. @Bucks",DrKiesl

258,2019-04-08 15:34:17+00:00,Milwaukee,1115276685098799105,With the amount of minutes @Giannis_An34 plays and what he brings to the court there is no way you can not name him MVP. We can win all 82 games and they still wouldn’t give us (Milwaukee) the respect they deserve. That’s ok just more motivation to prove-’em wrong #FearTheDeer,2Blessed2Strezz

264,2019-04-09 16:45:46+00:00,Milwaukee,1115657062783115267,People really saying that Giannis is “too humble” because he’d rather work on his basketball craft than star in movies over the summer? ,Mr__fantastic__
265,2019-04-09 16:51:36+00:00,Milwaukee,1115658532379136002,The thing I like about Giannis is that he doesn’t ever come out talking to the media. It’s always them asking him questions. He saves his talking for the court. #FearTheDeer,just_brede
266,2019-04-09 22:52:14+00:00,Milwaukee,1115749289144332288,Watching Harden fans rip on Giannis’s game is hilarious. Look he can only drive to hole. He goes right into the chest of the defender that’s not basketball. Umm the first thing you learn in grade school basketball is if your go by to drive go directly into the defender ,Sanpatso5
