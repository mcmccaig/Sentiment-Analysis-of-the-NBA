A jet is a fluid traveling at higher speed than the surrounding fluid. (In this case, the surrounding fluid is the sparse intergalactic medium.)",DrPhiltill
6393,2019-03-30 16:30:20+00:00,Orlando,1112119897151148032,"28/ Second, it emanates from a sourxe of high energy before expanding into the surrounding medium. In a rocket, the high energy is from fuel burning in the combustion chamber. With galactic jets, it is the energy of matter being extremely squeezed by a black hole.",DrPhiltill
6394,2019-03-30 16:33:24+00:00,Orlando,1112120671549693952,"29/ Third, something is holding the jet together until it reaches the extinction length. In rocket plumes, it is the surrounding atmospheric which has low enough viscosity that it doesn't mix too much. It galactic jets I'm no expert but I think an embedded magnetic field helps.",DrPhiltill
6395,2019-03-30 16:35:56+00:00,Orlando,1112121307301376013,30/ Fourth there is internal structure that radiates light at certain distances down the jet. In rocket plumes it is the shock waves from the plume over- and under- expanding in the surrounding air. In galactic jets it is also caused by embedded shock waves.,DrPhiltill

That's a little different than the reason electrons radiate in a rocket shock wave, but the similarity makes me happy :)",DrPhiltill
