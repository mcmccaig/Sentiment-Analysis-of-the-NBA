Note how this rocket plume gets narrower right after it leaves the nozzle. That's because it comes out at lower pressure than the surrounding air. ,DrPhiltill
5859,2019-03-30 21:04:41+00:00,Orlando,1112098343247851525,"3/ The job of the rocket nozzle is to expand the plume. If the nozzle is too small, then the plume is underexpanded, so it gets bigger right after leaving the nozzle. Here's an underexpanded plume from the Apollo Saturn V 2nd stage. See how it flares wider? ",DrPhiltill

5864,2019-03-30 21:18:18+00:00,Orlando,1112101770778546176,"6/ The jet goes too wide, then swings back too narrow, then too wide repeatedly. Every time it gets too narrow, the compressed gas gets very hot and radiates extra light. The bright spots at these narrow spots are called Mach diamonds. You can see them in the Rocket Lab plume.

Here it is in three different wavelengths. It even has internal structure, reminiscent of Mach disks in rocket plumes! (Image credit here http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2001/0134/)",DrPhiltill
5880,2019-03-30 22:28:06+00:00,Orlando,1112119335563206656,"27/ We shouldnt try to take the similarity too far, but it does have the following in common with rocket plumes. First, it is a jet. A jet is a fluid traveling at higher speed than the surrounding fluid. (In this case, the surrounding fluid is the sparse intergalactic medium.)",DrPhiltill
5881,2019-03-30 22:30:20+00:00,Orlando,1112119897151148032,"28/ Second, it emanates from a sourxe of high energy before expanding into the surrounding medium. In a rocket, the high energy is from fuel burning in the combustion chamber. With galactic jets, it is the energy of matter being extremely squeezed by a black hole.",DrPhiltill
5882,2019-03-30 22:33:24+00:00,Orlando,1112120671549693952,"29/ Third, something is holding the jet together until it reaches the extinction length. In rocket plumes, it is the surrounding atmospheric which has low enough viscosity that it doesn't mix too much. It galactic jets I'm no expert but I think an embedded magnetic field helps.",DrPhiltill
5883,2019-03-30 22:35:56+00:00,Orlando,1112121307301376013,30/ Fourth there is internal structure that radiates light at certain distances down the jet. In rocket plumes it is the shock waves from the plume over- and under- expanding in the surrounding air. In galactic jets it is also caused by embedded shock waves.,DrPhiltill
5884,2019-03-30 22:38:01+00:00,Orlando,1112121830289100800,"31/ In a galactic jet's shockwaves the electrons are accelerated to spin around the embedded magnetic fields and then the electrons give off photons. That's a little different than the reason electrons radiate in a rocket shock wave, but the similarity makes me happy :)",DrPhiltill
5885,2019-03-30 22:40:04+00:00,Orlando,1112122346821824513,"32/ Finally, we might think that this embedded magnetic field with free electrons swirling around is unique to the physics of galactic cores, too exotic for rocket exhaust. We would be wrong. It turns out, rocket exhaust is actually an electrically charged plasma. How exotic! :)",DrPhiltill
