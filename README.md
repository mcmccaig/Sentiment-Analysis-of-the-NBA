# Sentiment-Analysis-of-the-NBA
Data Science Capstone Project exploring the question: Is all publicity good publicity? Through Sentiment Analysis of the NBA and its effect on game-to-game attendance.

## Summary
In the realm of combat sports, both negative publicity and positive publicity drive attendance to matches. I wondered, does this also apply to team sports? To explore this, I decided to do a Sentiment Analysis of tweets of five NBA teams during the 2018-2019 regular season and seeing if there is an effect on game-to-game attendance.

## Training Data
Training data was taken from the SemEval Project and the Sentiment140 Project.
